# Copies
Since this is self explanatory, I won't overextend any explanation. This repository represents my training with CSS and HTML, so that I'm able to create websites. For now they do
not have any JavaScript functionality in them, because I'm still getting started. The method I decided to train with is making copies of known websites from scratch. :)
